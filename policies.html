            <p><span>Delivery policy</span>:At present, the express industry is booming, bringing more convenience to our lives. Generally, all express mail arrives at a certain place, centralized storage at headquarters, and then dispatched separately by the salesman; for express companies, in order to ensure that the express can reach the destination within a specified time, there must be enough salesmen to deliver the goods, but too many salesmen mean more dispatch costs.</p>
            <p><span>return policy</span>:
            <ul>
                <li>1. Exchanges can only be exchanged for products of the same amount or price.</li>
                 <li>   2. Please contact customer service when you confirm the quality problem of the goods at the time of receipt, inform the specific situation of the quality problem of the goods, the quantity of the products and take photos to provide the relevant evidence to customer service.</li>
                 <li>   3. For the buyer's own reasons (such as inappropriate size or dislike), under the condition of guaranteeing that the goods are brand-new and do not affect the second sale of the goods, the date of signing and receiving shall prevail and be dealt with within 30 days.</li>
                 <li>   4. If skin care products need to be returned or exchanged, it is necessary to ensure that the packaging is complete and not dismantled, without affecting the second sale.</li>
                 <li>   5. Guarantee complete parts and gifts for refund/exchange of goods, complete invoices or sales details already issued;</li>
